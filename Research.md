### Theme

We have an interest in B-cell lymphomas and are focusing on scenarios that are associated with poor outcome such as early progression after treatment, transformation to aggressive lymphoma and relapse in the central nervous system. We are applying cutting-edge tools to primary patient samples to unravel tumour heterogeneity and to develop novel, innovative biomarkers to predict outcome in lymphoma. Furthermore, we are leveraging novel findings from discovery platforms to elucidate mechanisms of lymphoma pathogenesis, tumour evolution and treatment resistance. Our ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through a better understanding of the diversity of responses to treatment and by tailoring therapy to each individual patient.

### Research pillars

**1. Predicting outcome of follicular lymphoma using genomic approaches**

Follicular lymphoma is clinically heterogeneous and treatment decision rely on clinical indices. However, the catalogue of genetic alterations observed in any given patient may provide the substrate for reponse following treatment. We mine existing and new datasets to identify novel genetic outcome predictors. The ultimate goal is to develop clinical-grade biomarkers that help us personalize therapies.
