### Principal Investigator

**Robert Kridel, MD PhD**

Robert is a Clinician-Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto. He trained in medical oncology in Geneva, Switzerland, prior to moving to Vancouver where he obtained his PhD from the University of British Columbia and completed a lymphoma fellowship at the BC Cancer Agency. Robert's research interests lie in the application of genomic approaches to lymphoma samples, aiming to better understand how genetic alterations contribute to prognosis, treatment resistance and tumour evolution.

### Post-doctoral fellow

**Michael He, PhD**

Michael completed his BSc (Hons) and PhD training at the University of Melbourne and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Australia; after obtained a BPharm (Hons) at Monash University, Australia. During his PhD, he developed a novel 3D CRISPR screening platform to understand blood endothelial cell response to cancer therapy, which further revealed epigenetic interactions with anti-angiogenesis for understanding of drug resistance. This has resulted in publication of several review, technical and research articles as well as grant applications. Michael’s current research is on overcoming resistance to epigenetic therapy and defining precise medicine/novel therapeutics in B-cell lymphoma using multi-omics including CRISPR–Cas9 gene-editing technology. The ultimate goal is to uncover strategies for more effective therapy finally towards improved patient outcomes.
