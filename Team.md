### Principal Investigator

**Robert Kridel, MD PhD**

Robert is a Clinician-Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto. He trained in medical oncology in Geneva, Switzerland, prior to moving to Vancouver where he obtained his PhD from the University of British Columbia and completed a lymphoma fellowship at the BC Cancer Agency. Robert's research interests lie in the application of genomic approaches to lymphoma samples, aiming to better understand how genetic alterations contribute to prognosis, treatment resistance and tumour evolution.

### Post-doctoral fellows

**Rajesh Detroja, PhD**

Rajesh completed his Ph.D. studies at Bar-Ilan University, Israel. During his Ph.D., he developed a novel fast, and accurate tool for identifying known human chimeric sequences from high-throughput sequencing data, which was further used to study the expression of recurrent chimeric RNAs in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients. This has resulted in the publication of several research articles. Rajesh's current research is to study multi-omics profiling of B-Cell lymphoma and circular tumor DNA using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis. The ultimate goal is to classify the types of lymphomas for effective diagnosis and therapy towards patient outcomes.

Research interests: Cancer Genomics, Transcriptomics, Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, Translational Research

Expertise: Cancer Genomics, Multi-omics Data Analysis, Clinical Statistics

**Michael He, PhD**

Michael completed his BSc (Hons) and PhD training at the University of Melbourne and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Australia; after obtained a BPharm (Hons) at Monash University, Australia. During his PhD, he developed a novel 3D CRISPR screening platform to understand blood endothelial cell response to cancer therapy, which further revealed epigenetic interactions with anti-angiogenesis for understanding of drug resistance. This has resulted in publication of several review, technical and research articles as well as grant applications. Michael’s current research is on overcoming resistance to epigenetic therapy and defining precise medicine/novel therapeutics in B-cell lymphoma using multi-omics including CRISPR–Cas9 gene-editing technology. The ultimate goal is to uncover strategies for more effective therapy finally towards improved patient outcomes.

Research interests: Lymphoma Treatment, Drug Resistance, Novel Therapeutics, Cancer Epigenetics, Cancer Biology, Translational Research

Expertise: Functional Genomics, Drug Response, Genetic Screening, Signaling Transduction, Cell Biology, Assay Development, Drug Development, Epigenetic Therapy, Anti-Angiogenic Therapy

### Graduate student

**Noorhan Ghanem, MSc**

Noorhan graduated with a Bachelor’s in Biochemistry at \ Beirut Arab University and obtained her Master’s of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. She was working on investigating therapeutic opportunities in treating colorectal cancer by targeting the pentose phosphate pathway and sensitizing resistant cells to 5-Fluorouracil. She is currently pursuing her doctoral studies at the University of Toronto in the Dept. of Medical Biophysics, working under the co-supervision of Dr. Robert Kridel and Dr. Aaron Schimmer. Noorhan’s current research interest focuses on deciphering treatment resistance in Adult T cell Leukemia-Lymphoma (ATLL), a rare type of virally induced lymphoma with a severe and dismal prognosis.
