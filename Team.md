### Principal Investigator

**Robert Kridel, MD PhD**

Robert is a Clinician-Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto. He trained in medical oncology in Geneva, Switzerland, prior to moving to Vancouver where he obtained his PhD from the University of British Columbia and completed a lymphoma fellowship at the BC Cancer Agency. Robert's research interests lie in the application of genomic approaches to lymphoma samples, aiming to better understand how genetic alterations contribute to prognosis, treatment resistance and tumour evolution.

### Scientific Associates

**Kit Tong, PhD**

Kit is a Scientific Associate and Lab Manager in our lab. She obtained her PhD in Medical Sciences, MSc in Epidemiology, and BSc in Biochemistry from Univ. of Tsukuba, Univ. of London, and Univ. of Saskatchewan. She developed interest in blood cancers during her post-doctoral training through studying therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Her current research is on developing combination treatment to combat therapy resistance in lymphomas.

**Michael He, PhD, BSc (Hons), BPharm (Hons)**

Michael completed his BSc (Hons) and PhD training at the University of Melbourne and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Australia; after obtained a BPharm (Hons) at Monash University, Australia. During his PhD, he developed a novel 3D CRISPR screening platform to understand blood endothelial cell response to cancer therapy, which further revealed epigenetic interactions with anti-angiogenesis for understanding of drug resistance. Michael’s current focus is on (1) investigating immunomodulating mechanisms to potentiate epigenetic therapy, (2) characterizing tumor microenvironment interactions, and (3) defining precision medicine/novel therapeutics in B-cell lymphoma. The ultimate goal is to uncover strategies for more effective therapy finally toward improved patient outcomes.

### Staff Computational Biologists

**Ting Liu, PhD**

Ting is a Senior Bioinformatics Analyst, having previously worked as a bioinformatics staff both at SickKids and the University of Toronto. Ting has extensive experience with large-scale data analysis and genome biology.

**Victoria Shelton, MHSc, BSc (Hons)**

Victoria is a Junior Bioinformatic & Data Analyst, and a graduate of the MHSc Medical Genomics program at the University of Toronto. Her primary focus has been the investigation of genetic biomarkers of follicular lymphoma. She recently presented this work at the 64th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition, and was honoured to receive an ASH Abstract Achievement Award.

### Research Technician

**Mehran Bakhtiari, MSc**

Mehran is a Research Technician in our lab. He holds a MSc degree in Biological Sciences from Laurentian University. Mehran has extensive experience with managing large-scale projects, molecular biology and screening of primary tissue and serum samples. He oversees accrual, processing and inventory of primary patient samples in our lab.

### Post-doctoral fellows

**Rajesh Detroja, PhD**

Rajesh completed his Ph.D. studies at Bar-Ilan University, Israel, where he developed a novel fast, and an accurate tool called ChiTaH to identify known human chimeric sequences from high-throughput sequencing data. ChiTaH was later used to study the expression of recurrent chimeric RNAs in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients. Rajesh is interested in studying the multi-omics of cancer by applying bioinformatics and machine learning technologies. His current research includes the study of multi-omics profiling of B-Cell lymphoma and circular tumor DNA using Next-Generation Sequencing data analysis. This will help classify the types of lymphomas for effective diagnosis and treatment.

### Graduate students

**Noorhan Ghanem, MSc**

Noorhan graduated with a Bachelor’s in Biochemistry at Beirut Arab University and obtained her Master’s of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. She was working on investigating therapeutic opportunities in treating colorectal cancer by targeting the pentose phosphate pathway and sensitizing resistant cells to 5-Fluorouracil. She is currently pursuing her doctoral studies at the University of Toronto in the Dept. of Medical Biophysics, working under the co-supervision of Dr. Robert Kridel and Dr. Aaron Schimmer. Noorhan’s current research interest focuses on deciphering treatment resistance in Adult T cell Leukemia-Lymphoma (ATLL), a rare type of virally induced lymphoma with a severe and dismal prognosis.

**Uditha Maduranga, BSc (Hons)**

Uditha graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. Prior to joining the lab, he worked as a Bioinformatics Analyst at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, where he investigated systemic interindividual epigenetic variants and metastable epialleles. Currently, Uditha is a PhD student in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto, co-supervised by Dr. Robert Kridel and Dr. Scott Bratman. His research primarily focuses on developing novel biomarkers and detecting minimal residual disease in lymphoma using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), integrating bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, and epigenomics.

**Davidson Zhao, BSc (Hons)**

Davidson graduated with a Bachelor’s in Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology at the University of Toronto. Before joining the lab, he was working on the identification of molecular genetic aberrations with prognostic relevance in acute myeloid leukemia. Currently, he is a graduate student in the Department of Medical Biophysics under the co-supervision of Dr. Robert Kridel and Dr. Federico Gaiti. Davidson is interested in deciphering the cell-cell interactions within the lymphoma tumour microenvironment.
