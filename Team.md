### Principal Investigator

**Robert Kridel, MD PhD**

Robert is a Clinician-Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto. He trained in medical oncology in Geneva, Switzerland, prior to moving to Vancouver where he obtained his PhD from the University of British Columbia and completed a lymphoma fellowship at the BC Cancer Agency. Robert's research interests lie in the application of genomic approaches to lymphoma samples, aiming to better understand how genetic alterations contribute to prognosis, treatment resistance and tumour evolution.

### Post-doctoral fellows

**Tracy Lackraj, PhD**

Tracy came to us from Ryerson University, after very successful doctoral studies in microbiology. She first-authored several papers on the pathogenicity of diarrheagenic pathogens during her PhD. Tracy is currently applying her molecular biology skills to lymphoma.

**Michael He, PhD**

Michael has recently joined the lab after completing his PhD in Melbourne at the Peter Mac. He comes to us with great exertise in CRIPR-Cas9 screens that he is no applying to lymphoma.

**Anjali Silva, PhD**

Anjali obtained her PhD in bioinformatics, with a focus on developing model-based clustering techniques for biological data. Anjali is applying unsupervised classification techniques to dissect the molecular heterogeneity of lymphoma. The goal of her project is to identify biologically defined molecular subtypes that may open new avenues for tailoring therapy.
