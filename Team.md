### Principal Investigator

**Robert Kridel, MD PhD**

Robert is a Clinician-Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto. He trained in medical oncology in Geneva, Switzerland, prior to moving to Vancouver where he obtained his PhD from the University of British Columbia and completed a lymphoma fellowship at the BC Cancer Agency. Robert's research interests lie in the application of genomic approaches to lymphoma samples, aiming to better understand how genetic alterations contribute to prognosis, treatment resistance and tumour evolution.

### Post-doctoral fellows

**Sleiman Bassim, PhD**

Sleiman has had extensive training in molecular biology and computational biology in France, Canada and the US. His interests lie in statistical modeling of treatment outcome using multiomics datasets, and in the discovery of novel biomarkers and pathways associated with lymphoma relapse.

**Tracy Lackraj, PhD**

Tracy came to us from Ryerson University, after very successful doctoral studies in microbiology. She first-authored several papers on the pathogenicity of diarrheagenic pathogens during her PhD. Tracy is currently applying her molecular biology skills to lymphoma.

**Anjali Silva, PhD**

Anjali obtained her PhD in Bioinformatics from the University of Guelph. Her doctoral work was focused on model-based clustering techniques. Anjali also has experience working in several research facilities, conducting advanced analysis of sequencing, protein and microarray data.
