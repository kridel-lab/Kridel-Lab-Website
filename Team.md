### Principal Investigator

**Robert Kridel, MD PhD**

Robert is a Clinician-Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto. He trained in medical oncology in Geneva, Switzerland, prior to moving to Vancouver where he obtained his PhD from the University of British Columbia and completed a lymphoma fellowship at the BC Cancer Agency. Robert's research interests lie in the application of genomic approaches to lymphoma samples, aiming to better understand how genetic alterations contribute to prognosis, treatment resistance and tumour evolution.

### Post-doctoral fellows

**Tracy Lackraj, PhD**

Tracy came to us from Ryerson University, after very successful doctoral studies in microbiology. She first-authored several papers on the pathogenicity of diarrheagenic pathogens during her PhD. Tracy is currently applying her molecular biology skills to lymphoma.

**Anjali Silva, PhD**

Anjali obtained her PhD in bioinformatics, with a focus on developing model-based clustering techniques for biological data. Anjali is looking into dissecting the molecular heterogeneity of lymphoma by applying unsupervised classification techniques to multi-omics datasets. The goal of her project is to identify biologically defined molecular subtypes that may open new avenues for tailoring treatments.

### Students

**Jesse Joynt, BSc**

Jesse has recently completed his BSc at Queen's University in Kingston. His project aims to uncover novel epigenetic vulnerabilities using CRISPR-Cas9 screens.

**Sharon Yoon, BSc**

Sharon has joined the lab as our first MSc student after completing her Bachelor of Science from University of Toronto Scarborough. Sharon's research focuses on the identification of rational combination treatments to overcome resistance in B-cell lymphoma.
