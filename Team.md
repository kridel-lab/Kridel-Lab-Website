### Principal Investigator

**Robert Kridel, MD PhD**

Robert is a Clinician-Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto. He trained in medical oncology in Geneva, Switzerland, prior to moving to Vancouver where he obtained his PhD from the University of British Columbia and completed a lymphoma fellowship at the BC Cancer Agency. Robert's research interests lie in the application of genomic approaches to lymphoma samples, aiming to better understand how genetic alterations contribute to prognosis, treatment resistance and tumour evolution.

### Clinical and Research Fellow

**Tomohiro Aoki, MD PhD**

Tomohiro is a Clinical Research Fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. He trained in hematology and oncology in Japan. From his front-line experience as a hematologist and oncologist, he felt a strong desire to pursue translational research to improve patient survival for refractory lymphoma patients. Then, he obtained PhD at Nagoya University in Japan and moved to Vancouver where he learned cutting-edge translational research skills. The central focus of his research is to understand how interactions between immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells regulate the development and treatment resistance of lymphoid cancers. The ultimate research goal is to discover biomarkers and novel treatment targets.

### Post-doctoral fellows

**Rajesh Detroja, PhD**

Rajesh completed his Ph.D. studies at Bar-Ilan University, Israel, where he developed a novel fast, and an accurate tool called ChiTaH to identify known human chimeric sequences from high-throughput sequencing data. ChiTaH was later used to study the expression of recurrent chimeric RNAs in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients. Rajesh is interested in studying the multi-omics of cancer by applying bioinformatics and machine learning technologies. His current research includes the study of multi-omics profiling of B-Cell lymphoma and circular tumor DNA using Next-Generation Sequencing data analysis. This will help classify the types of lymphomas for effective diagnosis and treatment.

**Michael He, PhD, BSc (Hons), BPharm (Hons)**

Michael completed his BSc (Hons) and PhD training at the University of Melbourne and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Australia; after obtained a BPharm (Hons) at Monash University, Australia. During his PhD, he developed a novel 3D CRISPR screening platform to understand blood endothelial cell response to cancer therapy, which further revealed epigenetic interactions with anti-angiogenesis for understanding of drug resistance. Michael’s current focus is on (1) investigating immunomodulating mechanisms to potentiate epigenetic therapy, (2) characterizing tumor microenvironment interactions, and (3) defining precision medicine/novel therapeutics in B-cell lymphoma. The ultimate goal is to uncover strategies for more effective therapy finally toward improved patient outcomes.

### Graduate student

**Ioana Gavriliuc**

Ioana graduated with a Bachelor’s in Biomedicine at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. For her thesis, she was working on single-cell RNA-sequencing of human neuroblastoma bone marrow samples, analyzing the transcriptomic differences within the metastatic and non-metastatic tumour microenvironment. She is currently pursuing her Master’s degree at the University of Toronto in the Institute of Medical Sciences, working under the supervision of Dr. Robert Kridel. Apart from her passion for oncological and immunological studies, she is working on developing her bioinformatical skills.

**Noorhan Ghanem, MSc**

Noorhan graduated with a Bachelor’s in Biochemistry at Beirut Arab University and obtained her Master’s of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. She was working on investigating therapeutic opportunities in treating colorectal cancer by targeting the pentose phosphate pathway and sensitizing resistant cells to 5-Fluorouracil. She is currently pursuing her doctoral studies at the University of Toronto in the Dept. of Medical Biophysics, working under the co-supervision of Dr. Robert Kridel and Dr. Aaron Schimmer. Noorhan’s current research interest focuses on deciphering treatment resistance in Adult T cell Leukemia-Lymphoma (ATLL), a rare type of virally induced lymphoma with a severe and dismal prognosis
