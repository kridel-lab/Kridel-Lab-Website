[Histological Transformation and Progression in Follicular Lymphoma: A Clonal Evolution Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002197). Kridel R, Chan FC, et al. PLOS Medicine, 2016. Equal Contribution.

Using a combination of whole-genome sequencing, targeted sequencing, and digital droplet PCR, this study demonstrates divergent patterns of clonal evolution in patients with follicular lymphomas that undergo histological transformation vs. early progression. We found that transformed tumours are composed mainly of clones that are rare or absent at diagnosis, whereas tumours that progress early typically arise from highly prevalent clones at diagnosis. We also describe novel associations of gene mutations with transformation and early progression.
