This was a fantastic meeting organized by Francesco D'Amore from Aarhus and Christian Steidl from Vancouver. Keynote lecture given by Dr. Stephen Ansell from the Mayo Clinic. I had the pleasure to co-chair the session on transformed follicular lymphoma and to present our recently published data on clonal evolution in progressed and transformed follicular lymphoma.
