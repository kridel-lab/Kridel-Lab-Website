[FOXP1 expression is a prognostic biomarker in follicular lymphoma treated with rituximab-containing regimens](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/early/2017/11/09/blood-2017-08-799080). Mottok A,\* Jurinovic V,\* et al. Blood, 2017. \*Equal Contribution.

In this paper, we describe that high expression of the FOXP1 transcription factor predicts adverse failure-free survival in follicular lymphoma patients treated with immunochemotherapy. We also show that FOXP1 high and low expressors differ in specific gene mutations and gene expression changes.
