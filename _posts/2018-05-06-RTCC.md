[Please consider donating towards the Heme Team for the 2018 Ride to Conquer Cancer!](http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Ride/Toronto2018?px=4175647&pg=personal&fr_id=1641)

The Ride to Conquer Cancer is a 220km+ fundraising bike ride from Toronto to Niagara, benefiting Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.

The Heme Team was started by Dr. Hans Messner in 2008. Since then, our Team has raised over $740,000 to benefit cancer patients at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. This year, we are well on track to raise over $68,000, but your help is needed to achieve this goal.
