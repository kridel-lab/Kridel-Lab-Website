[Convergence of risk prediction models in follicular lymphoma](http://www.haematologica.org/content/early/2019/01/02/haematol.2018.209031.long). Silva A, et al. Haematologica, 2019.

In this paper, we follow up from our prior work, and show that high levels of FOXP1 expression are associated with high-risk assignment by the 23 gene predictor recently presented by our colleagues from France (Huet et al. Lancet Oncology 2018). This observation suggests commonality between both biomarkers and, indeed, we found that FOXP1 and genes included in the 23 gene predictor appear to operate in a common transcriptional network.
