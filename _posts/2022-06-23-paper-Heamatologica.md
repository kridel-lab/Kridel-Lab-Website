[In-depth characterization of intratumoral heterogeneity in refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma through the lens of a Research Autopsy Program](https://haematologica.org/article/view/haematol.2022.280900). Isaev K, ... Kridel R. Haematologica, 2022.

In this paper, we present a detailed characterization of intratumoral heterogeneity by applying whole genome sequencing to spatially separated tumor samples harvested at the time of autopsy (n = 24) and/or diagnosis (n = 3) in three patients presenting with refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
