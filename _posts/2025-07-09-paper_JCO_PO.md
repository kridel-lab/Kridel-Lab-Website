[Risk Assessment With Ultra-Low-Pass Whole-Genome Sequencing of Cell-Free DNA for Large B-Cell Lymphoma](
https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO-25-00200). Zhao D, Lang N, Liu T, ... Kridel R. JCO Precision Oncology, 2025.

In this paper, we found that ultra‑low‑pass whole‑genome sequencing of plasma provides a cost‑effective way to identify high tumor burden and chromosomal alterations—most notably del(17p)—that strongly predict outcome in both frontline and relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma.
